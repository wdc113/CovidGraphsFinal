# CovidGraphsFinal
 
To get this to run on your computer using intellij.. I don't know how to make it work for eclipse.. you can download the DataVisualNoPopulation-1 directory and save it to Macintosh HD/Users/your user name that has the house next to it/IdeaProjects in Finder. If you don't see that directory just make sure you run intellij first and it will create it. Once you have the DataVisualNoPopulation-1 folder there, you can open intellij and go to File Open and select the DataVisualNoPopulation-1 folder inside IdeaProjects.

Once you have the project loaded in intellij you can go into src/main/java/edu.dccc.csv and open the ReadCSVWithScanner class and right click anywhere in the code lines and click Run. That should output data to the console. You can open the Covid19_NYC_JFrame class and do the same right click Run and that should open a graph window using jfree. You can do the same thing with all of the classes in this directory!
 
The classes in src/main/java/edu/dccc/csv/ read the data out of the src/main/java/resources/ directory and do something with it. Either print lines to the console or graph it using jfree https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart.

This is my final project. I'm not sure how to get it to work with eclipse yet so you have to run with intellij. There are csv files and then classes that read that csv and graph the data.

If you run the class ReadVSVWithScanner inside of the main/java/edu/dccc/csv directory it should show lines of data.
If you run the class Covid19_NYC_JFrame inside of the main/java/edu/dccc/csv directory it should show a graph version of tha data.

Right now it's not showing the code correctly in git and I'm not sure why but I'm going to work on it.

Ok I figured it out, the code should be displaying now in src/main/java/edu/dccc/csv/
