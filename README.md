# CovidGraphsFinal
 
This is my final project. I'm not sure how to get it to work with eclipse yet. There are csv files and then classes that read that csv and graph the data.

If you run the class ReadVSVWithScanner inside of the main/java/edu.dccc.csv directory it should show lines of data.
If you run the class Covid19_NYC_JFrame inside of the main/java/edu.dccc.csv directory it should show a graph version of tha data.

Right now it's not showing the code correctly in git and I'm not sure why but I'm going to work on it.
